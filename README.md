When an IE user visits your page, they are directed to a message:

>"Warning! You are using Internet Explorer! Why?!?!

>To access this site, get a real browser, download Google Chrome."

Clone in your web root, copy contents from header.php to the top of your index.php file and you are all set, enjoy!

See a demo here - change your UA to IE or access with IE:
